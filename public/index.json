[{"content":"Liberalism, once the shining force behind Western democracy and global progress, now finds itself in a state of disrepair. It\u0026rsquo;s like that beloved cardigan we once wore proudly—it stood for rationality, order, and fairness, but now it looks tired, threadbare, and borderline embarrassing to wear outside. It\u0026rsquo;s not just an old-fashioned fashion statement but an ideological crisis.\nThe world we inhabit in 2025 bears little resemblance to the one we envisioned in the Blair years, when politics had a sheen of optimism. Tony Blair strode across the global stage with the calm confidence of a leading man in a Richard Curtis rom-com, promising \u0026ldquo;Cool Britannia\u0026rdquo; and an ever-brighter future.\nHowever, what happened to that dream? Where did we go wrong? The curtain on that vision fell long ago, and what followed was less Love Actually and more The End of the World as We Know It, with a soundtrack by Adam Curtis. Curtis, whose documentaries often explore the collapse of grand political ideas, would surely view the rise of populism and the election of Donald Trump for a second term in 2024 as yet another sign that the liberal order has run its course. Gone are the days of believing in the gentle optimism of Notting Hill, replaced by the harsh realities of America First, a global power vacuum, and a culture of suspicion and division. If Blair\u0026rsquo;s version of Britain was a sunlit romantic comedy, today\u0026rsquo;s world feels more like a dystopian nightmare crafted by Curtis—endless confusion, fractured ideologies, and political chaos on repeat.\nTake Trump\u0026rsquo;s re-election in 2024. A result that might have seemed absurd just a few years ago now feels too real. His second-term victory was not just about one man\u0026rsquo;s return to power but the culmination of a fracturing liberal order. America, once a beacon of democracy and liberal ideals, now lurches under a president who governs like a reality TV star, thriving on chaos, misinformation, and authoritarian-style governance. His re-election was a symbolic rejection of the liberal values that once dominated the West. After all, what could be more antithetical to liberalism than a leader who dismisses facts, defies democratic norms, and embraces populist theatrics?\nMeanwhile, the rest of the world is not faring much better. China, under the ever-strong grip of Xi Jinping, continues to assert its global dominance. Through its Belt and Road Initiative, China has invested heavily in infrastructure across Africa, Asia, and parts of Europe. It offers an alternative to the liberal model that once defined global politics. As liberal democracies remain preoccupied with internal chaos—fake news, populist uprisings, and disillusionment—China quietly builds roads and railways, forging strategic partnerships with a clarity of purpose that liberalism seems to lack.\nBack home, the fallout of Brexit offers a fitting metaphor for the collapse of liberal ideals in the UK. The United Kingdom, once the proud architect of democracy and human rights, now grapples with its post-EU identity in a way that Bridget Jones could only capture—a comedy of errors in which the British electorate has stumbled through questionable decisions and ill-fated political flings. Brexit, that absurd and self-destructive decision to leave the European Union, has left the nation in a state of political paralysis. We are left with a government that manages to be both clueless and defensive, wrapped in a blanket of bluster and half-hearted attempts at reconciliation. It is a political landscape where the \u0026ldquo;blue soup\u0026rdquo; of public opinion, once a smooth blend of ideas, now bubbles over with inflation, a cost-of-living crisis, and an increasingly fragile sense of national unity.\nMoreover, who could forget the Coalition of 2010? It was a political marriage between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats that never quite fit, much like a bad joke no one could stop telling. In his ill-fitting hotpants, Vince Cable tried in vain to hold things together, fully aware that the partnership was as uncomfortable as David Cameron pretending not to be an Etonian. If that was not the visual metaphor for the death of British liberalism, I do not know what is. Vince Cable in hotpants. Enough said.\nIn 2025, liberalism\u0026rsquo;s promises of a better, more inclusive world have faded into the ether. Populism is on the rise, authoritarian regimes are emboldened, and the grand vision of global cooperation and progressive values seems lost. Nations bicker, trade agreements crumble, and the rich continue to grow wealthier while the rest of us try to figure out how to survive another week of rising costs. Trump\u0026rsquo;s second term is no answer to these problems—it only compounds them. The dream of liberalism, once so vibrant, is now a tragic comedy where the actors know the script is broken, but no one is willing to rewrite it.\nSo, what is left? In this world, liberalism is like the last person at the party still trying to convince themselves that there is a happy ending ahead. It is the idealist clinging to the idea of progress, staring at the pile of takeaway containers (leftover from the promises of global justice and equality), wondering where it all went wrong. Where are those grand ideals now? Perhaps they got lost somewhere in the economic shuffle, buried under headlines about climate change denial, Brexit fallout, and the erosion of public trust in institutions.\nIf liberalism is ever to make a comeback, it will need more than good speeches and catchy slogans. It needs to rediscover its sense of purpose—its ability to listen to the people it claims to serve rather than just congratulating itself on its theoretical ideals. The liberalism we once believed in was about progress, fairness, and inclusivity. However, in its current form, it has become a relic of a bygone era—like that once-proud cardigan, threadbare and ill-fitting for the times we now face.\nThe future, it seems, belongs to those who can get things done—authoritarian regimes or populist leaders who understand that in a world like this, it is not enough to be right. You have to grab the microphone, perform the role of leader, and act like you know what you are doing—even if you don\u0026rsquo;t.\nIf liberalism is to survive meaningfully, it must accept its current failings, adapt to the changing world, and understand that self-congratulation won\u0026rsquo;t save it. The world has moved on. The question is: Will liberalism be able to catch up, or will it remain the faded star of a long-forgotten movie?\n","href":"http://localhost:1313/blog/whatever-happened-to-our-dreams-of-liberalism/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLiberalism, once the shining force behind Western democracy and global progress, now finds itself in a state of disrepair.

Since then, this policy has faced a more sustained and intense wave of opposition in the media than perhaps any other proposal in the party’s platform. Despite opinion polls indicating that the plan has garnered widespread public support, outlets like the Daily Mail continue to insist that a ‘class war’ is somehow being waged by the government.\nSome commentators have even argued that the government’s plan to axe the tax breaks afforded to private schools is driven by ‘envy and spite,’ yet this position seems wholly out of touch. The move is merely a pragmatic choice to direct further funds to state schools which have faced slashing cuts, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimating that it could raise £1.3-1.5 billion. Even Michael Gove, the former Conservative Education Secretary, argued in 2017 that this “egregious state support” should be scrapped to drive up funding for the 93% of students who attend state schools. Money which is desperately needed to repair crumbling classrooms, to tackle the teacher retention and recruitment crisis, and to close the widening attainment gap.\nThe need to impose VAT on private school fees to boost standards in the state sector has never been more urgent. Since 2010, the gap between private school fees and per pupil funding in state schools across England has more than doubled. Private schools have enjoyed generous tax breaks and rising fees in real terms, meaning that they can offer smaller class sizes and have the resources to foster essential life skills such as oracy. Meanwhile, state schools have been left struggling to afford the basics after years of underfunding. This has left the attainment gap stubbornly wide, with private school pupils now more than twice as likely to achieve the top grades at A-level compared to their state school counterparts.\nThe primary argument against this policy is the claim that it could drive families out of private schools, resulting in a mass influx of pupils into the already overstretched state sector. However, this claim does not stand up to scrutiny. Private schools have consistently hiked their fees at a rate well above inflation, and the movement of pupils into the state sector has been minimal. From 2003-04 to 2019-20, private school fees rose by 55% in real terms, but the number of students at private schools remained relatively stable, and demand for private education remained largely unchanged.\nApplying VAT to private school fees is not only a matter of starting to level the playing field, but it is also a fundamental question of fairness and consistency. Private education is a luxury that remains out of reach for the vast majority of families in England, making it difficult to justify exempting fee-paying schools from a tax that applies to countless other goods and services. Furthermore, private schools, which enjoy vast resources, are under no obligation to pass the full cost of the VAT onto parents: they have the capacity to absorb a significant proportion of it.\nFrom my own experience in a state school, I know that, despite the dedication of teaching staff, sustained cuts to per pupil funding and inequalities in levels of access to education throughout the pandemic have widened the attainment gap. In contrast, private schools continue to offer benefits far beyond the curriculum, from enhanced guidance to help students secure places on the most competitive university courses to a breadth of extra-curricular activities. Against this backdrop, it seems unjustifiable for £1.7 billion to be spent each year providing tax exemptions for some of the most elite institutions in the country. Labour’s plans should not be viewed as an ideological battle but as the right choice to make our tax system fairer and to divert more funds towards our struggling state schools.\n","href":"http://localhost:1313/blog/the-case-for-fairness-in-defense-of-axing-private-school-tax-breaks/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOn July 5th 2024, Labour took office with a mandate to apply Value Added Tax (VAT) at the standard rate of 20% on private school fees, and to revoke the charitable business rates relief currently enjoyed by England’s fee-paying schools .

The President’s triumphant resurgence – winning the popular vote, all seven swing states, and a governing trifecta – represents a total usurpation of the former, liberal world order. Biden’s presidency will now be seen by history as an interlude, a brief intermission in the Trump story, not the grand liberal revival many hoped for in 2020.\nFree-trade, respect for international institutions and international law, the very building blocks of our modern international system, are on the out. In their place, a volatile and transactional politics led by a superpower in it only for their own interests. Interests defined not in the broad, magnanimous terms of late 20th century American foreign policy, but instead the grim, Bismarckian Realpolitik of power and territorial expansion. NATO now appears more an American protection racket than a grand alliance, international institutions seem more a talking-shop for petty grievances than serious organisations, trade an arena for exploitation and extraction rather than mutual benefit.\nThe dangers of this transformation to Britain are clear. Destabilisation of NATO risks further conflict in Europe and continued coercion by a revanchist Russia. Trade wars risk Britain facing tariffs on our exports to America, our largest single trading partner. The shared, global interests of liberal democratic nations risk being undermined by division and self-interested policymaking.\nBut danger and volatility also breed opportunity. Britain is well-placed to seek an exemption from any broad-based American tariff measures, an opportunity to create unique economic advantages for the UK. Trump’s Anglophilia is well-known – he is, for example, in love with the Monarchy, describing Prince William as “really, very handsome” – and a major charm-offensive has great potential to win him over. If Britain doubles down on the principles on which my party was founded, free trade and economic liberalism, we can stand as a beacon of liberal prosperity in an increasingly mercantilist world.\nMoreover, as America turns in on itself, Britain is presented with an opportunity to deepen ties with our other allies such as the European Union, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. As Trump giddily launches threats at his Northern neighbour, Britain can now make a point of deepening ties whilst enjoying a stronger negotiating position as Canada looks for stable, reliable partners. Europe – divided by a rising far-right, threatened by Russia and facing abandonment by America – is under intensifying pressure and Britain can enjoy a far stronger negotiating position with the continent than we did in 2016.\nTrump’s presidency brings danger and volatility to the international stage. The stakes have risen, risk and opportunity abound. Britain has the opportunity to ride out this storm and come out all the stronger.\n","href":"http://localhost:1313/blog/trumps-inauguration-bodes-danger-and-opportunity-for-britain/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDuring every single day of the Trump administration, I will very simply put America first” declared the 45th and now 47th President, standing in the same Capitol rotunda that his supporters rampaged through four years ago.

It would be ignorant to dismiss the rapid social progression that has followed. However, the popularisation of inclusivity initiatives has uncovered numerous shortfalls, creating an invisible working class.\nInclusivity (or ‘access’) initiatives engage individuals from low socioeconomic backgrounds in skills development, which is a commendable operation and should not be rejected by society, although the application processes for these initiatives risk excluding the borderline individual. This is an individual who sits between class lines, traditionally they are working class but certain characteristics are associated with a more privileged background; take, for instance, the individual with parents who attended university but grew up in an economically unstable household, or vice versa. Possessing such blurred characteristics is not uncommon, yet inclusivity initiatives do not wholly accommodate them, thus contributing to the division of the working class. Those captured by the inclusivity system are members of the visible working class, whilst those excluded from such protection are mere invisibles. This is the analogy of the invisible working class.\nWhilst this discrepancy is inherent in all initiatives, the likelihood of it manifesting depends on the processes involved in an application. Typically, application processes can be categorised into two types: those that consider mere background and those that balance background with merit. The former is most contestable, as assistance is provided based on need, an agreeable principle if the pivotal issue concerns welfare. However, it does not; rather, it involves social mobility. By incorporating merit in the application process, the exclusion of the invisible class diminishes as contextualisation becomes a tool for recognising achievements, rather than determining whether an individual ticks all the boxes of ‘access’: justifiable on the selectivity of initiatives.\nThe existence of initiatives that only consider an applicant\u0026rsquo;s background demonstrates the urgency of improving career services in state education, as initiatives of this kind provide career insights, mentoring, and opportunities for skills development. It is shameful that these necessities have been capitalised into something competitive to attain, only initiatives that provide something more than this minimum standard should be retained. This would create more time-worthy opportunities for individuals, encouraging a proactive approach to career progression.\nOverall, the development of inclusivity initiatives should be celebrated; however, there is a danger of dividing the working class into the visible and invisible. This ought to be rectified by improving the quality of career services in state education and modifying the provision of support that these initiatives traditionally provide.\n","href":"http://localhost:1313/blog/the-invisible-working-class/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eModern Britain prides itself on placing ordinary, working-class people at the forefront of society since its adoption of a meritocratic social agenda in the late 20th century.

An age of Brexit, of Boris and of a Britain that everyone seems to agree isn’t going so well. An age of identity politics, the Ben Shapiro’s, the TikTok debates, and of Elon musk buying twitter in the name of “free speech”. Through all this, I wonder, have we lost the point?\nIt seems like we have forgotten what matters: the actual governing. When Boris claims he’ll “Get Brexit done”, what was it he was really doing? Was it the customs union? As if the average voter knew what that meant. Was it the immigration? As if they’ve achieved that. Or was it in fact £350 million that would fix our NHS? Nearly 10 years on I’m not sure that’s been done either. It’s all well and good to speak in grand terms, to promise big things and make bold pledges, but the reality of government seems especially boring. Should we be taking politics more seriously?\nThe problem is that boring stuff doesn’t get people interested, and in a democracy, that’s quite important. Besides, what’s politics without emotion; that’s like politics without a soul. If we want to get people interested in politics, maybe this lack of seriousness is necessary, this constant din of noise, of scandal and story.\nDespite this - or maybe because of it - people don’t seem to be engaging in politics when it counts. Keir Starmer, despite his many criticisms of Corbyn, received 2 million fewer votes, and won the support of less than 20% of the electorate. Politics seems too confusing; government is complex, it needs to be, it is the job of managing the entire running of a country. But this complexity makes democracy challenging, it becomes ever harder to tell the charlatans from the sage, and that matters, it is how governments get held to account.\nPerhaps more concerningly, while we all discuss how immorally dashing Keir Starmer looks in his newest suit, the world moves on. When politicians are caught in the political minefield of the day, how can they continue to legislate effectively? This means those in places of power, like Mr. Musk, like Mr. Murdoch, like big tech become less and less accountable, each and every day, in a world that needs regulation more than ever. Government must hold this power to account, or in time there may be no government. Moreover, there seems to be an unsettling rise in political movements dependent on this misinformation, that use this confusion and emotion as their fuel.\nPolitics has never been simple, but today it seems more complicated than ever. Politics needs emotion, it needs values and principles, but the name of these things, our democracy is being broken down. We are led, ever closer to corporate capture, to poor governance and the breakdown of our liberal order. Politics is confusing, but we need it, we need to think about it, to talk about it, to engage in it, and I really hope we can do that without the scandal, without the poll, or the story. Politics is complicated, but it can work, we need to make it work, or we must live with the consequences.\n","href":"http://localhost:1313/blog/why-is-politics-confusing/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWe appear to live in an age of media games, of rhetoric, of the sound bite and the one-liner.
