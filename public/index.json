[{"content":"Modern Britain prides itself on placing ordinary, working-class people at the forefront of society since its adoption of a meritocratic social agenda in the late 20th century. It would be ignorant to dismiss the rapid social progression that has followed. However, the popularisation of inclusivity initiatives has uncovered numerous shortfalls, creating an invisible working class.\nInclusivity (or ‘access’) initiatives engage individuals from low socioeconomic backgrounds in skills development, which is a commendable operation and should not be rejected by society, although the application processes for these initiatives risk excluding the borderline individual. This is an individual who sits between class lines, traditionally they are working class but certain characteristics are associated with a more privileged background; take, for instance, the individual with parents who attended university but grew up in an economically unstable household, or vice versa. Possessing such blurred characteristics is not uncommon, yet inclusivity initiatives do not wholly accommodate them, thus contributing to the division of the working class. Those captured by the inclusivity system are members of the visible working class, whilst those excluded from such protection are mere invisibles. This is the analogy of the invisible working class.\nWhilst this discrepancy is inherent in all initiatives, the likelihood of it manifesting depends on the processes involved in an application. Typically, application processes can be categorised into two types: those that consider mere background and those that balance background with merit. The former is most contestable, as assistance is provided based on need, an agreeable principle if the pivotal issue concerns welfare. However, it does not; rather, it involves social mobility. By incorporating merit in the application process, the exclusion of the invisible class diminishes as contextualisation becomes a tool for recognising achievements, rather than determining whether an individual ticks all the boxes of ‘access’: justifiable on the selectivity of initiatives.\nThe existence of initiatives that only consider an applicant\u0026rsquo;s background demonstrates the urgency of improving career services in state education, as initiatives of this kind provide career insights, mentoring, and opportunities for skills development. It is shameful that these necessities have been capitalised into something competitive to attain, only initiatives that provide something more than this minimum standard should be retained. This would create more time-worthy opportunities for individuals, encouraging a proactive approach to career progression.\nOverall, the development of inclusivity initiatives should be celebrated; however, there is a danger of dividing the working class into the visible and invisible. This ought to be rectified by improving the quality of career services in state education and modifying the provision of support that these initiatives traditionally provide.\n","href":"http://localhost:1313/blog/the-invisible-working-class/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eModern Britain prides itself on placing ordinary, working-class people at the forefront of society since its adoption of a meritocratic social agenda in the late 20th century.

An age of Brexit, of Boris and of a Britain that everyone seems to agree isn’t going so well. An age of identity politics, the Ben Shapiro’s, the TikTok debates, and of Elon musk buying twitter in the name of “free speech”. Through all this, I wonder, have we lost the point?\nIt seems like we have forgotten what matters: the actual governing. When Boris claims he’ll “Get Brexit done”, what was it he was really doing? Was it the customs union? As if the average voter knew what that meant. Was it the immigration? As if they’ve achieved that. Or was it in fact £350 million that would fix our NHS? Nearly 10 years on I’m not sure that’s been done either. It’s all well and good to speak in grand terms, to promise big things and make bold pledges, but the reality of government seems especially boring. Should we be taking politics more seriously?\nThe problem is that boring stuff doesn’t get people interested, and in a democracy, that’s quite important. Besides, what’s politics without emotion; that’s like politics without a soul. If we want to get people interested in politics, maybe this lack of seriousness is necessary, this constant din of noise, of scandal and story.\nDespite this - or maybe because of it - people don’t seem to be engaging in politics when it counts. Keir Starmer, despite his many criticisms of Corbyn, received 2 million fewer votes, and won the support of less than 20% of the electorate. Politics seems too confusing; government is complex, it needs to be, it is the job of managing the entire running of a country. But this complexity makes democracy challenging, it becomes ever harder to tell the charlatans from the sage, and that matters, it is how governments get held to account.\nPerhaps more concerningly, while we all discuss how immorally dashing Keir Starmer looks in his newest suit, the world moves on. When politicians are caught in the political minefield of the day, how can they continue to legislate effectively? This means those in places of power, like Mr. Musk, like Mr. Murdoch, like big tech become less and less accountable, each and every day, in a world that needs regulation more than ever. Government must hold this power to account, or in time there may be no government. Moreover, there seems to be an unsettling rise in political movements dependent on this misinformation, that use this confusion and emotion as their fuel.\nPolitics has never been simple, but today it seems more complicated than ever. Politics needs emotion, it needs values and principles, but the name of these things, our democracy is being broken down. We are led, ever closer to corporate capture, to poor governance and the breakdown of our liberal order. Politics is confusing, but we need it, we need to think about it, to talk about it, to engage in it, and I really hope we can do that without the scandal, without the poll, or the story. Politics is complicated, but it can work, we need to make it work, or we must live with the consequences.\n","href":"http://localhost:1313/blog/why-is-politics-confusing/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWe appear to live in an age of media games, of rhetoric, of the sound bite and the one-liner.

Since then, this policy has faced a more sustained and intense wave of opposition in the media than perhaps any other proposal in the party’s platform. Despite opinion polls indicating that the plan has garnered widespread public support, outlets like the Daily Mail continue to insist that a ‘class war’ is somehow being waged by the government.\nSome commentators have even argued that the government’s plan to axe the tax breaks afforded to private schools is driven by ‘envy and spite,’ yet this position seems wholly out of touch. The move is merely a pragmatic choice to direct further funds to state schools which have faced slashing cuts, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimating that it could raise £1.3-1.5 billion. Even Michael Gove, the former Conservative Education Secretary, argued in 2017 that this “egregious state support” should be scrapped to drive up funding for the 93% of students who attend state schools. Money which is desperately needed to repair crumbling classrooms, to tackle the teacher retention and recruitment crisis, and to close the widening attainment gap.\nThe need to impose VAT on private school fees to boost standards in the state sector has never been more urgent. Since 2010, the gap between private school fees and per pupil funding in state schools across England has more than doubled. Private schools have enjoyed generous tax breaks and rising fees in real terms, meaning that they can offer smaller class sizes and have the resources to foster essential life skills such as oracy. Meanwhile, state schools have been left struggling to afford the basics after years of underfunding. This has left the attainment gap stubbornly wide, with private school pupils now more than twice as likely to achieve the top grades at A-level compared to their state school counterparts.\nThe primary argument against this policy is the claim that it could drive families out of private schools, resulting in a mass influx of pupils into the already overstretched state sector. However, this claim does not stand up to scrutiny. Private schools have consistently hiked their fees at a rate well above inflation, and the movement of pupils into the state sector has been minimal. From 2003-04 to 2019-20, private school fees rose by 55% in real terms, but the number of students at private schools remained relatively stable, and demand for private education remained largely unchanged.\nApplying VAT to private school fees is not only a matter of starting to level the playing field, but it is also a fundamental question of fairness and consistency. Private education is a luxury that remains out of reach for the vast majority of families in England, making it difficult to justify exempting fee-paying schools from a tax that applies to countless other goods and services. Furthermore, private schools, which enjoy vast resources, are under no obligation to pass the full cost of the VAT onto parents: they have the capacity to absorb a significant proportion of it.\nFrom my own experience in a state school, I know that, despite the dedication of teaching staff, sustained cuts to per pupil funding and inequalities in levels of access to education throughout the pandemic have widened the attainment gap. In contrast, private schools continue to offer benefits far beyond the curriculum, from enhanced guidance to help students secure places on the most competitive university courses to a breadth of extra-curricular activities. Against this backdrop, it seems unjustifiable for £1.7 billion to be spent each year providing tax exemptions for some of the most elite institutions in the country. Labour’s plans should not be viewed as an ideological battle but as the right choice to make our tax system fairer and to divert more funds towards our struggling state schools.\n","href":"http://localhost:1313/blog/the-case-for-fairness-in-defense-of-axing-private-school-tax-breaks/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOn July 5th 2024, Labour took office with a mandate to apply Value Added Tax (VAT) at the standard rate of 20% on private school fees, and to revoke the charitable business rates relief currently enjoyed by England’s fee-paying schools .
