People often ask me over coffee or at events what the Liberal Democrats plan to do in office. My honest answer is simple: I do not know.

At first glance, admitting that might seem politically reckless, the kind of confession that invites mockery. Yet in an age of over-certainty, the Lib Dems’ refusal to offer a detailed blueprint could be their most effective move. It suggests a party that is pragmatic, adaptable, and open to influence rather than rigidly ideological.

Few other parties could take this approach. Labour, being in government, must have a clear plan. You cannot speak of an island of strangers one moment and then condemn racism the next, unaware of how that language recalls Enoch Powell’s Rivers of Blood speech, a tone even the Conservatives once disowned. This highlights how the expectation of possessing a rigid ideological narrative can trap a party into positions which are easily criticised. Whereas the flexibility of the Lib Dems permits responses to issues without being bound by past statements.

The Lib Dems have instead chosen deliberate moderation. On economics, they occupy centrist ground. On social and foreign policy, they have in recent years adopted a more modern liberal stance, edging toward the left. Their emphasis on social justice, environmental action, and corporate responsibility represents a move away from classical liberal minimalism toward a socially conscious liberalism designed to appeal to voters weary of ideological extremes. Domestically, a focus on practical, achievable policies makes the party accessible and unthreatening to a broad electorate. Rather than fighting for ideological dominance, they present themselves as the safe, sensible alternative. In the 2024 election, that approach delivered a record 72 MPs, proving that quiet credibility can often achieve more than noisy conviction.

Their next challenge is consolidation. If Reform UK performs strongly and divides the right, and if Labour continues to struggle in office, voters may again turn to the calm middle ground. The Greens under Zack Polanski are growing in visibility, but their support remains too geographically thin to break through under first-past-the-post. The Lib Dems’ policy record gives them the credibility to translate moderate support into seats. In the water industry, they have called for enforceable performance standards and transparency measures to hold companies accountable while maintaining market incentives. On environmental policy, they back a practical decarbonisation strategy focused on renewables investment and clean energy innovation. Their approach to corporate accountability emphasises fair competition and consumer protection rather than heavy-handed regulation. Even in local government and health policy, they favour targeted reforms such as improving access to community health services and allocating resources more efficiently rather than sweeping structural overhauls. These policies are not flashy, but they signal competence, pragmatism, and the ability to manage complexity without ideological posturing.

Ed Davey might even have taken Hayek’s notion of *The Road to Serfdom* literally – swapping economic caution for a wetsuit and deciding that a little surfing could not hurt the free market. 

In politics, as in markets, adaptability remains the most rational plan of all.
